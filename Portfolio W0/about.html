                 I am Apurva Kashish, a college student currently studying Metallurgical Engineering in IIT BHU. While engineering is not really my passion,
                    writing is what drives me. Writing poems and stories works as a therapy for me and I feel freer to express what there's in my mind which cannot be
                    spoken out. When I was in class 11th, I started writing and publishing my content on a popular online publishing app, Pratilipi. I received a lot 
                    appreciation from the platform and took part in writing competitions. My novel "I Wish I Were A Boy!" came 7th in the contest "Women of Wonders"
                    hosted by Pratilipi. Link to my novel given below

                I write a lot of poems, mainly in English langauage and a handful of Hindi ones. You can check them out using the quick links given below or clicking the Poems tab
