                   Hello there. Currently my midsems are going on and finally my last exam is tomorrow, the subject being MA-102. It is relatively easier than MA101 but yeah, our Profs are same somewhat and they will find every possible to snatch away our marks.
                   Why is life full of struggle?
                   Umm, it is supposed to be so.
                   Before I get too philosophical, let's switch the topic.
                   My parents had arrived today in the afternoon and came to meet for an hour. They were so apprehensive about taking up my time, they were literally checking time every 10 min.
                   Okay I googled the meaning of apprehensive and i think I used it in a very exaggerated sense.
                   Uhm anyways, feelings are to be understood, not meaning. (Philosophically yours).
                   My preparation for MA102 is fine i guess. Tbh, i don't know what exactly will happen in the paper so not thinking much. Just emphasising on my basics and my mistakes and my lessons and i guess i am good to go.
                   So i am thinking of sleeping early today to wake up early tomorrow.
                   And because i am thinking of sleeping now, i thought of making it a relaxing atmosphere. So now Ananya is playing songs and I am writing my entry.
                   Then tomorrow, after i take the exam, parents will come to take me and we will do mastiðŸ˜Š. We will go to watch movie also. And have good food.
                   Then they will go on Sunday.
                   ðŸ’”
                   I think i should try falling asleep now. So that i can wake up around 6 -6:30 am tomorrow.
                   Will revise the notes and the papers. I think overdoing anything makes it worse. 
                  Okay, bye goodnight. Will write whenever i get time.
