                    After so many years,<br>
                    We see each other.<br>
                    Remember how you used to <br>
                    Hold my cheeks.<br>
                    Not me trying to dig it up,<br>
                    It's just that it brims up my eyes.<br>
                    I swear I tried a lot,<br>
                    But no matter,<br>
                    I couldn't forgive you.<br>
                    I couldn't forget you.<br>
                    Remember how I left,<br>
                    My dead body at your doorstep,<br>
                    And my ripped soul lying in your backyard,<br>
                    My mind is like an old graveyard.<br>
                    I would be lying if I didn't accept<br>
                    That loving you was <br>
                    A bittersweet dream I dreamt<br>
                    Now every day is a fight for me,<br>
                    Thinking what could have right in me.<br>
                    Though I know you never deserved me,<br>
                    I also know, I didn't deserve you.<br>
                    But something kept pushing me towards you.<br>
                    Don't know whether was it attraction<br>
                    Or some scary heart infarction<br>
                    But I used to keep my eyes on you.<br>
                    Hoping that every day you keep smiling,<br>
                    Even if I am buried in the graveyard<br>
                    Of your memories and of your heart<br>
                    That afternoon, you looked at me,<br>
                    I was coloured in the ashes of our dreams.<br>
                    I know we cared too much for each other<br>
                    So much that we ended up losing each other<br>
                    I know our ending wasn't bad<br>
                    But it left me in the graveyard<br>
                    Of failed emotions and a broken heart<br>
                    You told me I was a good person<br>
                    So did I thought about you<br>
                    And now I wonder whether I was right<br>
                    No matter how much we cried that night<br>
                    A void is always left for you to fill in<br>
                    Till then, I am sitting on the tombstone,<br>
                    Of a friendship forlorn.<br>
