I stand by the balcony and feel the breeze<br>
Definitely in the street someone sneezed<br>
I know it because I saw two mynas<br>
A lucky charm if a pair <br>
And if single you are in despair<br>
I saw the pair many years later<br>
Should I use my luck calculator<br>
I am in no mood to make some sense<br>
Or drown people in philosophical essence<br>
I want to be free<br>
I just want to watch the old tree<br>
The clouds seem a bit shady<br>
I think I heard the cry of the Misty Lady<br>
Lo! The drops started pouring slowly<br>
And wind started blowing shyly<br>
The plants in my balcony were dried to death<br>
But now they are going to be re-energised after a long wait<br>
I don't smile feeling the first drops of the rain<br>
It won't soothe my pain<br>
I see the sky<br>
There is no bird left to fly<br>
Not even a single raven<br>
All of them locked up in their haven<br>
I keep looking waiting for the best part<br>
Which shakes my heart hard<br>
Oh! See the silver lining<br>
No it is not of my cloud, it is someone else's belonging<br>
It is a random night<br>
And words dance in my mind<br>
I remembered a good line<br>
But now it has vanished before I could be on cloud nine<br>
Once again I am betrayed by my own self<br>
I am no Miss White nor do have I have any elf<br>
I am just merely struggling <br>
I am just stuck in middle of something<br>
Listen, the sound came later<br>
Like action speaks louder<br>
Words often get unheard.<br>
I don't want to smile it is tiring<br>
I have given in to staring<br>
It is a random night and I don't have much to do<br>
Although the pending work keeps calling me in a loop<br>
I am still trying to remember that perfect line<br>
But it is as unimportant as this random night.<br>
