               <h1 class="H1">DIAMONDS DON'T SHINE</h1> 
The soul has been burnt,<br>
The fuel has got exhausted.<br>
Nothing left to think about.<br>
Just one feeling left <br>
Sounds of hollowness echo from abysmal depth<br>
Disappointment is someone's adornment.<br>
You cannot deny this statement.<br>
Some diamonds try to shine.<br>
But they assume they are just carbon from inside.<br>
Glass shine easily<br>
And they forget they break even more easily.<br>
But diamonds pay the price of being precious.<br>
They endure the pain of heat and pressure<br>
Just to be beheld by a few of taste<br>
And get overrated by the rest.<br>
Do they know?<br>
Being a diamond is hard.<br>
Diamonds don't shine.<br>
They burn from inside<br>
The pain you don't see<br>
The glitter blinding your sight.<br>
Try to know the inner beauty <br>
Cause there is a complicated heart inside it<br>
You will never know how to get through it.<br>
You keep trying to get the diamond<br>
And stay poor enough to lose it one day<br>
Diamonds don't shine,<br>
They reflect their pain brightly,<br>
Tricking people into believing they're smiling.<br>
I once knew a diamond,<br>
It undervalued itself in front of the mirror.<br>
The mirror broke one day,<br>
Yet the diamond never could see,<br>
Who was stronger between the two,<br>
Cause the mirror broke easily.<br>
The diamond didn't notice it precisely.<br>
Diamonds don't shine.<br>
Cause they think glass shine better<br>
I cannot change their way of thinking.<br>
Could you make them realise this?<br>
Or are you a diamond yourself, dear critics?<br>
