               <h1 class="H1">MAROON CEMETRY</h1> 
               In the barren land, <br>
               I laid dead<br>
               The sunrays hitting me right into my eyes<br>
               Not a drop of water left<br>
               To rescue me from the inevitability<br>
               Somebody walked upon me gently<br>
               And caressed my cracks slowly<br>
               Drops empathy fell between my chapped lips<br>
               And the life of a dying newborn was renewed again<br>
               The seed absorbed the affectionate rain<br>
               And it kept growing into something so wonderful<br>
               I got a life and it felt so beautiful<br>
               Trees of trust and hope grew upon me<br>
               As someone walked over my pasture<br>
               Greenery plagued my misery<br>
               And an unstable thin film of happiness <br>
               Protected my plants from the angry sun man<br>
               I dug inside myself to find a source of quenching thirst<br>
               I used it to water my dear seed<br>
               Who now grew up in a beautiful flowery tree<br>
               Somebody smelled the daisies and rosemary adorning the tree<br>
               And was astonished how could a midnight lily tree <br>
               Could bloom into any variety<br>
               That was me,<br>
               Changeable yet constant <br>
               My job was only watering the tree<br>
               It hardly mattered what bloomed inside the heart of my tree<br>
               I was happy in this trance<br>
               When suddenly one day<br>
               Somebody tore into the film of my happiness<br>
               And sprayed the seed of poison ivy all over my land<br>
               I kept witnessing each and every blade of grass dying,<br>
               Frankly, I felt helpless as I knew nothing was left in my hand<br>
               The water can dropped, the acid rain dropped harder<br>
               The greenery converted into a maroon cemetery<br>
               All my plants and trees shriveled into a dead red entity<br>
               And when I looked upon the sun man <br>
               He was appearing innocent to me<br>
               Maybe it was not him<br>
               Maybe it was somebody<br>
               To my horror, the somebody and sun had the same face<br>
               Their rays which were once so beautiful<br>
               Again hit me in the eyes to the point I got blind<br>
               (Before blind in love and now blind out of revenge)<br>
               And now, in this messed up process of trust and betrayal<br>
               I am left with no option to choose<br>
               I have to witness the maroon cemetery<br>
               Where once lied a green monastery<br>
               Where once love bloomed in its brightest hues<br>
               Now the barren land is left only with rues<br>
               Of pain, detachment and drops of acid rain<br>
               Somebody would now say words to defend themselves<br>
               I would like to say one more thing before this ends<br>
               You might have been right at times,<br>
               But you weren't always<br>
               You might have tried to play with words<br>
               But you never knew me<br>
               Maybe today I look the caretaker of this maroon cemetery<br>
               But once, I was the nun of the green monastery<br>
               I can make both gentle prayers and fiery lashes<br>
               Don't try to enter the maroon cemetery<br>
               Because somebody's grave is dug already.<br>
