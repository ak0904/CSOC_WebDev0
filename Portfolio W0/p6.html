               <h1 class="H1">TO EVIL TO BE LOVED</h1> 
               Roses don't allure,<br>
               I give people pain to endure<br>
               I am evil beneath the alias<br>
               Having no quanta of remorse<br>
               People try loving me<br>
               And often they get bitten by me<br>
               Too Evil to be Loved sweetheart,<br>
               I am too evil to be loved!<br>
               
               Watching my prey,<br>
               As they wish for me in their pray,<br>
               I lie and I deceive<br>
               I am a sadist with all ease<br>
               They cry, they shout and they go crazy<br>
               And I laugh at them, sitting on the couch like a lazy,<br>
               Too Evil to be Loved sweetheart,<br>
               I am too evil to be loved!<br>
               
               They say history recreates the unwanted<br>
               A while ago I was too taunted,<br>
               Why being evil was my middle name,<br>
               How I ended up to this fame,<br>
               I quietly smile and leave the room,<br>
               'Cause the evil doesn't gloom.<br>
               
               There was a time when I was the victim,<br>
               The evil being my only love,<br>
               I smiled and walked right into their trap<br>
               And reality woke me up with a big slap<br>
               I was betrayed with full intentions,<br>
               My love was made of satanic dimensions.<br>
               
               Ever since then I am infected<br>
               With this contagious wicked<br>
               I meet new people to afflict them with pain,<br>
               I love it when I see their eyes filled with rain<br>
               Too Evil to be Loved, they call me,<br>
               And I walk away with their sobriety,<br>
               'Cause I am too evil to be loved, sweety!<br>
